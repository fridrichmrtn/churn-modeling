    "The classical approach to retention management is to identify the customers at high risk of churning and persuade them to stay active with promotional offers. Predictive solutions are, however, primarily evaluated in terms of the classification task, not in the retention management context. To reflect on those additional steps, we propose an evaluation procedure inspired by the retention campaign (Neslin et al., 2006) and generated profit frameworks (Tamaddoni et al., 2015).\n",
